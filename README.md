#Overview#
<br />
Alma Labs has a gaming project called Tokiemon.io, where users can mint 1-of-1 AI
monsters & battle, level up, etc. Users do not have a great way to see and sort all of their
ERC721 Tokiemon on the Base blockchain.

This task is designed to solve that problem by giving people a view of all their monsters on
a dedicated web app that you build.

#Task#
1. Build a simple frontend in React, where users can log in with their wallet and see
their tokiemon
a. You can mint a free one at Tokiemon.io on Base if you need an example
2. Query all the user’s Tokiemon metadata via smart contract, and based on the
token’s URI, display the information about each Tokiemon they hold
a. Information should include tokiemon ID, picture, community, rarity, and tier
(all available via API)
3. Add some basic sorting and searching functionality to your app for users to sort
through their Tokiemon

#Expected Deliverables#
1. A URL I can use to log in and test with my existing Tokiemon
2. A Github repo of your work
